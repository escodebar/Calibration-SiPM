\section{Short-Baseline Near Detector}
one of the three liquid argon detectors - 112 ton active volume liquid argon time projection chamber LArTPC
110 meters from the BNB neutrino source, currently in design anticipated to begin operation in 2018

expected 1 million neutrino interactions per year (about a hundred events per hour).
